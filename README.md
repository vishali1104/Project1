This To-Do List Web App helps users add, complete, and delete tasks . It makes task management easy with interactive buttons and real-time updates. Users can easily type a task into the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list. Each task in the list comes with two buttons: one to mark it as completed, which strikes through the task to show it's done, and another to delete the task if it's no longer needed. The app gives a smooth, interactive experience with a clean and responsive design, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices. Everything is created using only basic web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—without any external libraries or frameworks.
